# Instructions for developers

## Testing the code

CircleCI will automatically run tests on Pull Requests to the `xdmod-data`
GitHub repository. `xdmod-data` will be tested against multiple Open XDMoD
portals, each running a different branch/tag of the `xdmod` repository. Each
Open XDMoD portal runs in a Docker container; the images for these are hosted
in the registry `tools-ext-01.ccr.xdmod.org/xdmod`, and the tags used for
testing are defined in `tests/config.yml` under `xdmod_images`.

`tests/config.yml` also defines the maximum Python version that should be
tested. This version will be tested along with the minimum supported versions
of Python and `xdmod-data`'s dependencies, as defined in `pyproject.toml`.
The two versions of Python will be tested in their own containers using the
CircleCI `cimg/python` convenience images.

Testing the code manually/locally involves using Docker Compose to emulate the
CircleCI setup. You will need to have Docker running and follow these steps:

1. If you wish to rename the containers and/or network that will be created,
   edit `tests/config.yml` and add a `container_names` property that maps names
   from `xdmod_images` to the container names. You can also rename the
   containers used for testing the minimum and maximum Python versions by
   defining names for `python-min` and `python-max`, respectively. You can also
   set either one of these to `null` in which case the corresponding Python
   container will not be created. Note that you do NOT need to rename every
   container. You can rename the network using the `network_name` property. For
   example, the following definition will rename only the last two XDMoD
   containers as well as the container that tests the maximum Python version
   and the network. It also makes it so the minimum Python container is not
   created:
    ```yaml
    xdmod_images:
      - xdmod-data-main
      - xdmod-data-xdmod11_0
      - xdmod-data-v11_0_0-1_0
    container_names:
      xdmod-data-xdmod11_0: my_custom_name_1
      xdmod-data-v11_0_0-1_0: my_custom_name_2
      python-min: null
      python-max: my_custom_name_3
    network: my_custom_name_4
    ```
1. Start up the Docker Compose application stack:
    ```
    python3 ./tests/scripts/docker_compose.py up
    ```
1. Set up each of the Python containers you want to test with. For example, for
   Python 3.14:
    ```
    docker exec xdmod-data-python-3.14 python3 ./tests/scripts/setup.py
    ```
1. If you will be testing the minimum Python version, downgrade the
   dependencies in that container. For example, for Python 3.11:
    ```
    docker exec xdmod-data-python-3.11 python3 ./tests/scripts/downgrade_dependencies.py
    ```
1. Run the tests in each Python container you want to test with. For example,
   for Python 3.14:
    ```
    docker exec xdmod-data-python-3.14 python3 ./tests/scripts/run_tests.py
    ```
1. Changing the code locally will automatically update it in the docker
   container because the Docker Compose application stack includes shared
   volumes.
1. If you want to run specific Pytest test(s), include it/them as arguments to
   `run_tests.py`. For example:
    ```
    docker exec xdmod-data-python-3.14 python3 ./tests/scripts/run_tests.py tests/pytest/regression/test_datawarehouse_regression.py::test_get_data[month]
    ```
1. You can generate new regression test artifacts by adding the
   `GENERATE_DATA_FILES` environment variable:
    ```
    docker exec -e GENERATE_DATA_FILES=1 xdmod-data-python-3.14 python3 ./tests/scripts/run_tests.py ./tests/pytest/regression
    ```
1. If you need to delete the Docker Compose application stack, run:
    ```
    python3 ./tests/scripts/docker_compose.py down
    ```

Linting can be done manually by running the commands in the `lint` job in
`.circleci/generate_config.py`.

To test with the notebooks in `xdmod-notebooks`, you can edit their first code
cell to replace `xdmod-data` and its version constraints with the following,
replacing `username` with your username and `branch-name` with the name of the
branch:
```
git+https://github.com/username/xdmod-data.git@branch-name
```

## Contributing a Pull Request (PR)

1. Get the PR reviewed.
1. Once the PR is approved and merged,
    1. In the release prep draft PR for the version under development:
        1. In `CHANGELOG.md`:
            1. Add the PR you just merged.
            1. If needed, update the summary of the version under development
               and its compatibility with Open XDMoD versions.
        1. In `README.md`:
            1. If needed, update the Open XDMoD compatibility matrix.
    1. If needed, port/backport the PR to other development branches, and
       update their release prep draft PRs as well.

## Releasing a new version

1. In the version's release prep draft PR:
    1. In `xdmod_data/__version__.py`, make sure the version number is updated.
    1. In `README.md`, make sure the Open XDMoD compatibility matrix is
       updated.
    1. In `CHANGELOG.md`, update the release date of the version and make sure
       it has a summary of the changes in the version and indicates the
       compatibility with Open XDMoD versions.
1. After the PR is approved (but not merged yet), follow these steps in a
   cloned copy of the branch:
    1. Start up a virtual environment, e.g.:
        ```
        python3 -m venv ~/xdmod-data-build-env
        source ~/xdmod-data-build-env/bin/activate
        ```
        Your command prompt should now start with `(xdmod-data-build-env)`.
    1. Make sure the required packages are installed:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip build setuptools twine
        ```
    1. Build the built distribution:
        ```
        python3 -m build --wheel
        ```
    1. Validate `setup.cfg`, e.g., for version 1.0.1:
        ```
        version=1.0.1
        twine check dist/xdmod_data-${version}-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        Make sure you receive `PASSED`.
    1. Upload the built distribution to TestPyPI:
        ```
        twine upload --repository testpypi dist/xdmod_data-${version}-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        Enter your TestPyPI API token.
    1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/project/xdmod-data and confirm that
       everything looks right.
    1. Upload the built distribution to PyPI:
        ```
        twine upload dist/xdmod_data-${version}-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        Enter your PyPI username and password.
    1. Go to https://pypi.org/project/xdmod-data and confirm the new version is
       the latest release.
1. Merge the PR.
1. Go to [create a new release on
   GitHub](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-data/releases/new) and:
    1. Click `Choose a tag`.
    1. Type in a tag similar to `v1.0.0` and choose `Create new tag`.
    1. Choose the correct target based on the major version you are developing.
    1. Make the release title the same as the tag name (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
    1. Where it says `Describe this release`, paste in the contents of the
       release's section in `CHANGELOG.md`. Note that single newlines are
       interpreted as line breaks, so you may need to reformat the description
       to break the lines where you want them to break. Use the `Preview` to
       make sure it looks right.
    1. Where it says `Attach binaries`, attach the built distribution (the
       `.whl` file) that was uploaded to PyPI.
    1. Click `Publish release`.
    1. Go to the [GitHub
       milestones](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-data/milestones) and close
       the milestone for the version.

## After release

1. If you just released a new major version (e.g., `2.0.0`),
    1. Create a branch off `main` for that major version (e.g., `v2.x.y`).
    1. For each major version below that major version (e.g., `1.x.y`), make a
       PR to that branch that updates `README.md` to add a link to the new
       version's README to the list under `For documentation of other
       versions:` and updates the main development branch's link text in that
       list to the next major version (e.g., `v3.x.y (main development
       branch)`). Get the PR approved and merged.
    1. In a PR to the `main` branch, update the `README.md` under the main
       heading, in the sentence that begins `This documentation is for ...`,
       update the version number in the bold text (e.g., `**v3.x.y (main
       development branch)**`. Get the PR approved and merged.
1. If you just released a new minor or patch version of a version that is not
   the most recent major version under development (e.g., `v1.1.0`):
    1. For each major version above that version's major version (e.g.,
      `v2.x.y`), in that major version's release prep draft PR:
        1. In `CHANGELOG.md`, make sure the version just released is present
           but that the PR numbers match the ones that were merged into the
           major branch whose Pull Request you are currently creating, NOT the
           branch that the release was tagged on.
        1. In the `README.md`, update the Open XDMoD compatibility matrix.
        1. Get the PR approved and merged.
1. In a PR to the same branch you just released:
    1. In `README.md`:
        1. If you just released a new major version:
            1. Under the main heading, in the sentence that begins `This
               documentation is for ...`, update the bold text from e.g.,
               `**v2.x.y (main development branch)**` to, e.g., `the **v2.x.y**
               versions`.
            1. In the list under `For documentation of other versions:`, update
               the main development branch's link text to the next major
               version (e.g., `v3.x.y (main development branch)`).
    1. Get the PR approved and merged.
1. For each new version under development:
    1. Go to the [GitHub
       milestones](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-data/milestones) and add a
       milestone for the new version under development.
    1. Create a release prep draft PR for the new version under development:
        1. In `CHANGELOG.md`:
            1. Add a heading for the new version under development with a date of
               `XXXX-XX-XX`.
            1. If you already know what will be done in the new version under
               development, write a summary of it.
            1. Add the expected compatibility with Open XDMoD versions.
        1. In `README.md`, add the new version under development to the Open XDMoD
           compatibility matrix.
        1. In `xdmod_data/__version__.py`, change the version number to a
           development release of the new version under development, e.g.,
           `3.0.0.dev1`.
